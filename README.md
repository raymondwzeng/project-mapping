# Project Mapping
A WIP project designed to bring an idle ARPG-esque experience to Roblox for my own enjoyment.
Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.1.1.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "project-mapping.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `project-mapping.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
